**Description:** `This repository provides libraries that allow adding JSON Web Token (JWT) based Bearer authentication into
Java Servlet applications.`

## Overview
This repository contributes to the development of **secure, scalable, and interoperable data-sharing infrastructure**. It supports NDTP’s mission to enable **trusted, federated, and decentralised** data-sharing across organisations.

This repository is one of several open-source components that underpin NDTP’s **Integration Architecture (IA)**—a framework designed to allow organisations to manage and exchange data securely while maintaining control over their own information. The IA is actively deployed and tested across multiple sectors, ensuring its adaptability and alignment with real-world needs.

For a complete overview of the Integration Architecture (IA) project, please see the [Integration Architecture Documentation](https://github.com/National-Node-Net/integration-architecture-documentation).

### JSON Web Token (JWT) Servlet Authentication

Support is provided for both Servlet 3 (`javax.servlet`), Servlet 5 (`jakarta. servlet`) and
JAX-RS 3 (`jakarta.ws.rs`) based applications.

While some servlet containers provide integrated support for this, others don't, and even where support is provided the
flexibility of OAuth 2 (the specification that defined Bearer auth) can still leave implementations lacking.

[JWT][Rfc7519] based [Bearer Authentication][Rfc6750], while very simple at a high level, actually proves to be quite difficult in practise
because tokens can be issued by a huge variety of issuers using different signature algorithms, key management
techniques etc. To try and address this the library provides two main abstractions:

- `JwtAuthenticationEngine` - This is an abstract base class that implements the authentication flow with abstract
  methods provided that perform configurable portions of the flow e.g. selecting the HTTP Header(s) that convey the
  JWTs, finding the username from the verified token and transforming the request with the authenticated user identity.
- `JwtVerifier` - This is an interface for verifying tokens.

The aim being to decouple the flow of obtaining a token from verifying it, allowing the engine to be easily
repurposed for multiple servlet container runtime versions.

Concrete implementations of both are provided, see [Usage](INSTALLATION.md#usage) for example usage.

## Features
- **Key functionality**
  - Enables secure JWT-based Bearer authentication for Servlet 3 (javax.servlet), Servlet 5 (jakarta.servlet), and JAX-RS 3 (jakarta.ws.rs) applications. 
  - Provides `JwtAuthFilter`, which must be added based on the servlet runtime. 
  - Implements authentication via the `JwtAuthenticationEngine`.
  - Supports JWKS verification, including `CachedJwksKeyLocator` for efficient key retrieval. 
- **Key integrations**
  - Compatible with OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect (OIDC) for standard JWT authentication. 
  - Supports JWKS-based verification, allowing dynamic key fetching from a URL or local file. 
  - Provides AWS Cognito & ELB integration for AWS-specific authentication. 
  - Uses the [jjwt](https://github.com/jwtk/jjwt) library for JWT parsing and verification, with jjwt-jackson for JSON processing. 
  - Works with Servlet 3 and 5, with adaptability for Servlet 6 using the Servlet 5 module.
- **Scalability & performance**
  - Flexible runtime support, working across different servlet versions with provided dependencies.
  - Cached JWKS verification minimizes key-fetching overhead for better performance.
- **Modularity**
  - Designed as a modular component of NDTP’s Integration Architecture (IA).
  - Usable as a library in other projects via Maven dependency management.
